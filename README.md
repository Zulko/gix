# Gix - Gif, Share, Remix

[Gix](https://zulko.github.io/gix/#/home) is a GIF editor using web technologies:

<p><a href='https://zulko.github.io/gix/#/home' target='_'><img src='./docs/screenshot.jpeg'/></a></p>

- No account needed, no privacy issues, no server costs: just GIF in your browser.
- Share your projects as (long!) URLs, so others can build on your work.
- Freely create, combine, caption and animate.
- An interface that ~~is clean and intuitive~~ makes your GIFs look good by comparison.



## Project setup

```
yarn install
yarn serve  # compiles and hot-reloads for development
