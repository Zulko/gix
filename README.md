# Gix

Gix is a GIF editor using web technologies:

- No account needed, no privacy issues, no server costs: it runs entirely in your browser.
- Share your projects as (long!) URLs, so others can build on your work.
- Freely create, combine, caption, and animate.
- An intuitive (?) interface to make or remix GIFs in minutes.

**This is still work in progress. Expect no stability**
