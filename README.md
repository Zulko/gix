<p><a href='https://zulko.github.io/gix/#/home' target='_'><img src='./docs/screenshot.jpeg'/></a></p>

## Main features
- Gix runs entirely in your browser - no account needed, no privacy issues, no server costs.
- Social GIFing: share your projects as (long!) URLs, so others can remix them.
- Creative freedom: create, combine, caption and animate.
- An interface that ~~is clean and intuitive~~ makes your GIFs look good by comparison.



## Project setup

```
yarn install
yarn serve  # compiles and hot-reloads for development
yarn build  # compiles and minifies for production
```

## Contribute.

Gix is open source software originally written by Zulko and released on Github under the MIT License. This is still work in progress. Expect no stability. At this point, bug reports, bug fixes, and feature requests are welcome.
