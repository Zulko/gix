<p><a href='https://zulko.github.io/gix/#/home' target='_'><img src='./docs/screenshot.jpeg'/></a></p>

## Main features
- Gix runs entirely in your browser - no account needed, no privacy issues, no server costs.
- Social GIFing: share your projects as (long!) URLs, so others can remix them.
- Creative freedom: create, combine, caption and animate.
- An interface that ~~is clean and intuitive~~ makes your GIFs look good by comparison.



## Project setup

```
yarn install
yarn serve  # compiles and hot-reloads for development
yarn build  # compiles and minifies for production
```

## Contribute!

Gix is open source software originally written by Zulko and released on Github under the MIT License. This is still work in progress. Expect only medium stability at this point.

You can contribute by:

- Reporting bugs, requesting new features, suggesting new ideas. Open a new issue for that.
- Tackling any of the open issues marked "enhancement" of "bug" that is not assigned to someone else (comment on the issue so others know you are working on it).
